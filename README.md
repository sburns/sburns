### Hello!

My name is Scott, thanks for stumbling upon my little slice of GitHub.

I'm currently a Principal Software Engineer at [BambooHR][1] working on our data platform. I have previously built software to make healthcare data more actionable in an effort to deliver better care to patients. Before that I built MR image processing systems to better understand dyslexia in children. I thrive in building systems to derive meaning from difficult data. I focus on cultivating environments where we can safely ship valuable software and not lose sleep over it.

I'm married to [Elise][2] (who recently published her first book! ðŸŽ‰) and together we ~~herd~~ raise three kids. With the little time left beyond family and work, I enjoy exercising and am working towards my first Triathlon (Olympic) in August '22 ([results][4]). Here's my Strava [profile][3] if you're into that.

Some of my current values:

- Consistency > Intensity
- Progress > Perfection
- Explicit > Implicit
- Systems > Goals
